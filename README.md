# sidefox
## Fork Information
This project is a fork of [SideFox](https://github.com/refact0r/sidefox)
### Changes Made in This Fork
- Changed window controls to icons similar to typical Windows OS buttons
- Fixed issue with the private browser icon shifting the window control out of place
- Minor UI tweaks to Tree Style Tab css to my preference

## Original Desc
Some simple css to seamlessly integrate [tree style tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) into firefox. 
These tweaks were inspired by [flyingfox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox) which sadly is no longer active.

- Hides firefox's tab row
- Converts window controls into macos style circles and moves them into the navbar
- Hides tree style tab sidebar header
- Collapses sidebar to only show tab icons and expand on hover
- Makes tree style tab spacing more consistent

In order to remove mismatched colors, you can use the [Firefox Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-color/) extension to theme Firefox.

You can start by modifying my theme: https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAJnAgAAAAAAAABBqYhm849SCicxcUF-LXcGHf3p79EhVPXPtB1ibTLiQvLY1QylemTgx7ijSrcvWl_HVAmwvnKIJnESUiSA8WGCMfXU1SYZrivWJhOlLowTJB1L-VRPMYNnF_r80lHdEBe3JLDrssxSYl6JV73y6juaH4lGiVPQDt1Lj9TeHVcDa8QSIpBhHgvPYegKJAZUowU_gv4VV-W9WghvliFuPvZr3fkU1eQua_yYFAG5tCSfwVaPIlB3G7_wFktqujh2WHIEwmEJ-z3_g6hVudrcVRYee9sCImYJgfDyXLOMrYnkWRroe9XJxSzRZvxg_7Os6xvdxGy6Z8Nb2Deb-wJvIiem-rxhYYKkDlJjzl5pjnLRZaTFiPn9jmBY
